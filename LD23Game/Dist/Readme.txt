======================================
           Fusion Time!
======================================
By NeiloGD for Ludum Dare 23
Theme: Tiny World
======================================

You are strong force, that wonderful force responsible for fusing tritium and deuterium together to form helium.
This is what keeps our sun burning. You play the role of strong force and must fuse these together. Fusion costs
the sun some energy, so be sure to use it carefully and do it only when atoms are close enough together.

Start charging: Click LMB.
Activate fusion: Release LMB.

As the heat builds up, particles will move around faster, and the sun will glow stronger.
