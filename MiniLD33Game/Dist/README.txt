MiniLD 33 RTS (WIP!!)
---------------------

Controls:

Mouse to click and command units. (any mouse button).
A to toggle attack move (cursor is white for normal move, red for attack move).
Ctrl+0-9 for setting control groups.
0-9 to select control group.

Unit AI is very dumb, but it is functional!
Matchmaking is flakey at best (the dark grey screen), but should work most of the time on LAN, over the net...good luck. If you run 1 copies locally it should load up in 10-15 seconds after talking to the server.

You get 10 soldiers, 5 archers, 1 siege unit. Have fun :D

Also, <3 you Cell for the sprites ^_^

Expect sounds, and an actual screen for match making soon.

TO RUN LOCALLY:

Apparently running online won't work, so go into "config.json" and change the channel to something else. This will mean your copy will only negotiate over that channel.
