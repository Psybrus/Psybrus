wxMotif TODO
------------

Updated: 11/02/99

         -------------------------------o-------------------------

General comment: see the following site for useful Motif widgets.
ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/widgets/motif

Also, grep for TODO comments in source.

High Priority
-------------

- Have a central/per app file for colour settings, with a wxWin
  app to allow changing settings interactively.

- Implementation of default event processing (i.e. passing on an intercepted
  event such as OnChar to the system). Currently, such events are processed
  anyway, so for example intercepting left-click in a widget doesn't disable
  the default behaviour. See TODOs in window.cpp.

- wxToolTip

- Miscellaneous events.

- Allow wxFrame and other widgets to have mouse event handlers.

Low Priority
------------

- Painting a retained window could be optimized further (see
  wxWindow::DoPaint).

- Visuals: how to select an appropriate one? See Thomas Runge's
  visual patch for 1.68 -- should be straightforward to port to 2.0.

- Work out why XFreeFont in font.cpp produces a segv. This is
  currently commented out, which presumably causes a memory leak.

- New wxHelp version: try using the XmHTML widget at
  http://www.xs4all.nl/~ripley/XmHTML/.

  We need to:
  - make a minimal distribution under wx/src/xmhtml, just enough
    to compile the source.
  - add XMHTML_C_SRC to src/motif/makefile.unx with the source files
    listed.
  - make sure we can compile the sources, passing the correct
    flags for zlib/png compilation.
  - make a wxHTMLWindow class from e.g. examples/example_2.c. Should
    probably make the cache and history facilities part of the class.
  - add the driver code to src/motif/helphtml.cpp (a frame, toolbar,
    history list).

- Drag and drop. Use a standard X drag
  and drop standard - see http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~jafl/xdnd/
  or use Motif drag and drop as described here:
  http://www.motifzone.com/tmd/articles/DnD/dnd.html

- Optimize colour management so we don't get clashes when e.g.
  Netscape is running. See:
  http://www.motifzone.com/tmd/articles/John_Cwikla/index.html

- wxRCConfig (a config class using X .rc files). Could simply
  implement it in terms of current wxGet/WriteResource functions.

- Miscellaneous classes e.g. wxJoystick (identical to GTK's one for
  Linux)

- Work out why wxTextCtrl doesn't work as a stream buffer under
  gcc
