Descriptions of some of the example scripts

-----------------------------------------------------------

Snake.gm
Bomber.gm
BomberRun.gm
MineSweeper.gm

Were written in a few hours by programmers testing an early 
version of GameMonkey.  They were given the script 
reference, a copy of gme.exe and a syntax highlighter file.

-----------------------------------------------------------

gmDoc.gm (and related files)

Is a utility to scan through .cpp files, find comments 
relating to GM script bindings and generate a .html file 
documenting those functions.

-----------------------------------------------------------

benchmark.gm

Is a set of benchmarks used by Doug Bagley at 
http://www.bagley.org/~doug/shootout/
to compare the performance of several languages.
( Note that simply executing these scripts with 
different languages does not provide a true indication 
of comparative performance. )
