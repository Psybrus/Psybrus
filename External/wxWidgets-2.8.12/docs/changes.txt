-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES SINCE 2.6.x
================================

Changes in behaviour not resulting in compilation errors, please read this!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- For all wxInputStreams, Eof() becomes true after an attempt has been made
  to read _past_ the end of file.
- wxFileName::DirExists() checks if the path of the file is a directory, not
  if the whole name is a directory.
- wxDialog::CreateButtonSizer() may return NULL now, please see the manual.
- wxStaticBoxSizer now deletes the associated wxStaticBox when it is deleted.
- wxArray::Alloc() now works as reserve() and does not clear the array any more
- Windows calling CaptureMouse() are now required to handle the
  wxEVT_MOUSE_CAPTURE_LOST event and not call ReleaseMouse() in this case.
- wxInputStream::GetC() now returns an int in the range 0 - 255 on success
  instead of a char the range -128 - 127.


Changes in behaviour which may result in compilation errors
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Some classes (notably wxBitmap and wxImage) don't define operator==() as it
  used to work in somewhat unexpected way as it compared only internal pointers
  and not the object data. The code using it will have to be updated:
  * If the object was compared with wxNullXXX, use IsOk() method instead
  * If valid object need to be compared, use IsSameAs() to reproduce the old
    behaviour or change the code to avoid comparing bitmaps &c.
- wxFontData::GetColour() now returns a const colour.
- wxDC objects can't be created directly now (this never worked, now it doesn't
  even compile).
- wxCHECK family of macros now must be followed by a semicolon.
- wxMBConv::cMB2WC() and cWC2MB() take size of the input buffer and return
  length of the converted string in all cases now.
- wxHtmlWindow::OnCellClicked() now returns bool.
- wxHtmlCell::OnMouseClick() was deprecated and replaced with
  wxHtmlCell::ProcessMouseClick(); old code overriding OnMouseClick() will
  continue to work with WXWIN_COMPATIBILITY_2_6, but should be rewritten to
  use ProcessMouseClick().
- wxHtmlCell::GetCursor() was deprecated and replaced with
  wxHtmlCell::GetMouseCursor(); old code overriding GetCursor() will
  continue to work with WXWIN_COMPATIBILITY_2_6, but should be rewritten to
  use GetMouseCursor().
- wxHtmlCell::AdjustPagebreak() signature has changed, update your code if you
  override it.
- wxFontEnumerator::GetFacenames() and GetEncodings() now return arrays and
  not pointers to arrays.
- SetDefaultItem() method was moved from wxPanel to wxTopLevelWindow
- wxDialog::OnOK/OnCancel() don't exist any more, use SetAffirmative/EscapeId()
- wxPathList doesn't derive from (deprecated) wxStringList any more
- wxGLContext class has no 1:1 coupling to a wxGLCanvas class any more.
  As a consequence, the class interface changed largely. Code updates, if
  any are required at all, are easy to accomplish though.


Deprecated methods since 2.6.x and their replacements
-----------------------------------------------------

- wxGetWorkingDirectory() deprecated in favour of wxGetCwd().
- wxDC::BeginDrawing() and wxDC::EndDrawing() deprecated, don't use them.
- wxWindowBase::GetBestFittingSize --> wxWindowBase::GetEffectiveMinSize.
- wxWindowBase::SetBestFittingSize --> wxWindowBase::SetInitialSize.
- Seeking on a zip stream returned from wxFileSystem without using the new
  wxFS_SEEKABLE flags is deprecated. You can still seek, but use the flag.
- Constructor wxZipInputStream(const wxString& archive, const wxString& file)
  deprecated in favour of wxFileSystem (other zip ctors are not deprecated).
- wx{Dir|File}Dialog::{Set|Get}Style deprecated in favour of the generic
  wxWindow::{Set|Get}WindowStyle()


Major new features in 2.8 release
---------------------------------

- New AUI library supporting docking windows and much more.
- New rich text control library implementing a generic wxRichTextCtrl,
  using only the wxWidgets API. Also includes formatting dialogs, conversion
  to HTML, and printing classes.
- New wxComboCtrl class giving the ability to create custom, graphical
  comboboxes. Associated classes include wxOwnerDrawnComboBox, wxComboPopup
  and wxBitmapComboBox.
- Further functionality including wxAnimationCtrl (moved from contrib/src/anim
  and enhanced), wxSimpleHtmlListBox, wxHyperlinkCtrl, wxColourPickerCtrl,
  wxDirPickerCtrl, wxFilePickerCtrl, wxFontPickerCtrl, wxCollapsiblePane,
  wxSearchCtrl, wxAboutBox, wxTreebook, tar streams.


2.8.12:
-------

All:

- Fixed a bug in UNC path testing.
- Improved command line parser usage help.
- Fixed race condition bugs in wxCondition.
- Added wxT_2() for forward compatibility with wxWidgets 3. Use it in
  initialization of wxCmdLineEntryDesc struct elements and (very few) other
  places where wxT() is required currently but won't be allowed in v3.
- Fixed crash on exit caused by deleting old logger in wxLogChain dtor.

All (GUI):

- wxRTC: fixed style selection resetting after editing a style.
- wxRTC: can now edit line spacing in .1 increments from 1 to 2.
- wxRTC: fixed wrong line spacing and space after paragraph calculations.
- wxRTC: GetStyleMergedWithBase now detects loops.
- wxRTC: wxRichTextCtrl::ApplyStyle now applies a paragraph style at the
  cursor without needing a selection, and setting the default style now
  avoids duplicating character attributes in subsequently typed text when
  they exist in the paragraph style.
- wxRTC: fixed IsPositionVisible to scroll a position into view correctly.
- wxRTC: fixed a problem with paste resetting the content paragraph style.
- wxRTC: style list box now copes with names duplicated across style types.
  Also fixed wxRichTextStyleDefinition::GetStyleMergeWithBase similarly.

  the item is already in the desired state.
- Fixed bug in wxSizer::Replace(size_t, wxSizerItem *) whereby SetContainingSizer
  is not called.

- Removed ugly black (simple) border around wxHTML help window.

wxMSW:

- wxOwnerDrawnComboBox and wxComboCtrl with wxCB_READONLY window style now
  have more native-like focus indicator rendering.
- Fixed wxOwnerDrawnComboBox keyboard handling: drop-down is no longer
  displayed when arrow key is pressed (without Alt).

- Added check for double window handle creation.
- Fixed WIN64 crash in wxStyledTextCtrl.
- Fixed Watcom compilation when omitting threads.
- Fixed wxFileName::IsFileReadable on Windows 98.

  wxEVT_COMMAND_LISTBOX_SELECTED event. You need to set wxUSE_LISTBOX_SELECTION_FIX
  to 1 in include/wx/msw/listbox.h to enable this binary-incompatible fix.

wxGTK:

- Fix for --disable-radiobtn compilation.
- Fixed a bug on GTK+ only whereby wxGrid scrolls back to the previous edit position
  when another cell is edited.
- Fix for missing menubar problem under some window managers where menu bar height is
  reported as 0 when the menu hasn't fully realized yet. Now updates the height during
  idle time if it is 0, otherwise no menu is shown.
- Improved list control and tree control selection text theme compatibility by adding
  wxSYS_COLOUR_LISTBOXHIGHLIGHTTEXT colour index.
- wxComboCtrl and wxOwnerDrawnComboBox had wrong background colours under some
  themes (Marcin Wojdyr).
- Added thread-safe fixes to socket code.

wxUniv:

- Fixed assertion in tree control sample due to colour index not being supported.

2.8.11:
-------

*** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES: ***

   Due to an oversight, a bug fix in wxMSW resulted in an incompatible change in
   wxTreeCtrl behaviour: its EVT_TREE_ITEM_ACTIVATED handler now must skip the
   event being processed to allow the item to be toggled by double clicking on it.
   I.e. you need to ensure there is an "event.Skip()" in your item activation
   handler if you do wish to allow the item to be toggled.

All:

- Fixed crashes due to invalid input in PNG and TIFF image loaders (Tielei Wang).
- Fix compilation of wxWidgets headers with recent Sun CC (Brian Cameron).
  NB: If your code uses _T() macro you must either replace it with wxT() to
      use Sun CC or define wxNEEDS__T before including wx headers and avoid
      including many standard headers (again, only with this compiler).
- Added several functions forward compatible with wxWidgets 3.0 (troelsk):
  wxDC::SetDeviceClippingRegion(), wxShowEvent::IsShown(),
  wxIconizeEvent::IsIconized(), wxFileName::StripExtension(),

  in order to use common types where there are duplications, fixing problems
  where invalid sizes caused incorrect second invocation of page setup
  dialog.

- Added wxBORDER_THEME to XRC.
- Speeded up wxTreeCtrl by caching text size (botg).

  src/common/prntbase.cpp and wxUSE_ENH_METAFILE_FROM_DC in
  include/wx/msw/enhmeta.h.

- Prevented wxCheckListBox from corrupting menu items.

wxGTK:

- Don't access a possibly destroyed timer object from GTK callback (Tim Kosse).

- wxDynamicCast() now uses static_cast<wxObject *> internally and so using it
  with anything not deriving from wxObject will fail at compile time (instead
  of run-time) now
- when wxUSE_STL == 1 and STL provides quasi-standard hash_map/hash_set,
  wxHashMap/wxHashSet are just typedefs for them. This makes impossible
  to forward declare these classes.

  will now be called by default to determine the minimum size that a
  window in a sizer should have.  If you want to still use the initial
  size (and not the BestSize) then use the wxFIXED_MINSIZE flag.  When
  windows are added to a sizer their initial size is made the window's
  min size using SetSizeHints, and calls to wxSizer::SetItemMinSize
  are also forwarded to SetSizeHints for window items.

  and closer to wxMSW/wxGTK look. This can be disabled by setting
  motif.largebuttons system option to 1 (see wxSystemOptions).

OLD CHANGES
===========

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES SINCE 2.2.x
================================

    Please take a few minutes to read the following list, especially
    paying attention to the most important changes which are marked
    with '!' in the first column.

    Also please note that you should ensure that WXWIN_COMPATIBILITY_2_2
    is defined to 1 if you wish to retain maximal compatibility with 2.2
    series -- however you are also strongly encouraged to try to compile
    your code without this define as it won't be default any longer in
    2.6 release.

    NB: if you want to build your program with different major versions
        of wxWidgets you will probably find the wxCHECK_VERSION() macro
        (see the documentation) useful.


wxBase:

! wxArray<T>::Remove(size_t) has been removed to fix compilation problems
  under 64 bit architectures, please replace it with RemoveAt() in your
  code.

! wxArray<T> macros have been changed to fix runtime problems under 64 bit
  architectures and as a side effect of this WX_DEFINE_ARRAY() can only be
  used now for the pointer types, WX_DEFINE_ARRAY_INT should be used for the
  arrays containing non-pointers.

- wxObject::CopyObject() and Clone() methods were removed because they
  simply don't make sense for all objects

- wxEvent now has a pure virtual Clone() method which must be implemented
  by all derived classes, if you have user-defined event classes please
  add "wxEvent *Clone() const { return new MyEvent(*this); }" line to them

- small change to wxStopWatch::Pause() semantics, please see the documentation

- unlikely but possible incompatibility: the definition of TRUE has changed
  from "1" to "(bool)1" (and the same thing for FALSE), so the code which
  could be erroneously compiled previously such as doing "return FALSE" from
  a function returning a pointer would stop compiling now (but this change
  is not supposed to have any effects on valid code)

- another minor change: wxApp::OnAssert() has a new "cond" argument, you
  must modify YourApp::OnAssert() signature if you were using it to override
  the default assert handling.

All (GUI):

! the event type constants are not constants any more but are dynamically
  allocated during run-time which means that they can't be used as case labels
  in the switch()es, you must rewrite them to use if()s instead

  You may also define WXWIN_COMPATIBILITY_EVENT_TYPES to get the old behaviour
  but this is strongly discouraged, please consider changing your code
  instead!

! wxDialog does not derive from wxPanel any longer - if you were using it in
  your code, please update it. The quick fix for the most cases is to replace
  the occurrences of wxPanel with wxWindow.

! if you handle (and don't skip) EVT_KEY_DOWN, the EVT_CHAR event is not
  generated at all, so you must call event.Skip() in your OnKeyDown() if
  you want to get OnChar() as well

- in general, the key events sent for the various non ASCII key combinations
  have been changed to make them consistent over all supported platforms,
  please see the wxKeyEvent documentation for details

- wxYES_NO is now wxYES | wxNO and the manifest values of both wxYES and wxNO
  have changed (to fix some unfortunate clashes), please check your code to
  ensure that no tests for wxYES or wxNO are broken: for example, the following
  will *NOT* work any longer:

        if ( flags & wxYES_NO )
                ... do something ...
        if ( flags & wxYES )
                ... do something else ...

- static wxWizard::Create() doesn't exist any more, the wizards are created
  in the same way as all the other wxWindow objects, i.e. by directly using
  the ctor

- wxGLCanvas now derives directly from wxWindow, not wxScrolledWindow

- wxGridCellAttrProvider class API changed, you will need to update your code
  if you derived any classes from it

- wxImage::ComputeHistogram()'s signature changed to
  unsigned long ComputeHistogram(wxImageHistogram&) const

- wxEvtHandler cannot be copied/assigned any longer - this never worked but
  now it results in compile-time error instead of run-time crashes

- WXK_NUMLOCK and WXK_SCROLL keys no longer result in EVT_CHAR() events,
  they only generate EVT_KEY_DOWN/UP() ones

- the dialogs use wxApp::GetTopWindow() as the parent implicitly if the
  parent specified is NULL, use wxDIALOG_NO_PARENT style to prevent this
  from happening

- several obsolete synonyms are only retained in WXWIN_COMPATIBILITY_2_2 mode:
  for example, use wxScrolledWindow::GetViewStart() now instead of ViewStart()
  and GetCount() instead of Number() in many classes

- wxCmdLineParser does not use wxLog to output messages anymore.
  to obtain the previous behaviour, add
  wxMessageOutput::Set(new wxMessageOutputLog); to your program
  (you will need to #include <wx/msgout.h>)

wxMSW:

! build system changed: setup.h is not a static file in include/wx any more
  but is created as part of the build process under lib/<toolkit>/wx
  where <toolkit> is of the form (msw|univ)[dll][u][d]. You'll need to update
  the include path in your make/project files appropriately. Furthermore,
  xpm.lib is no longer used by wxMSW, it was superseded by the wxXPMDecoder
  class. You'll need to remove all references to xpm.lib from your
  make/project files. Finally, the library names have changed as well and now
  use the following consistent naming convention: wxmsw[ver][u][d].(lib|dll)
  where 'u' appears for Unicode version, 'd' -- for the debug one and version
  is only present for the DLLs builds.

- child frames appear in the taskbar by default now, use wxFRAME_NO_TASKBAR
  style to avoid it

- all overloads of wxDC::SetClippingRegion() combine the given region with the
  previously selected one instead of replacing it

- wxGetHomeDir() uses HOME environment variable and if it is set will not
  return the programs directory any longer but its value (this function has
  never been meant to return the programs directory anyhow)

- wxHTML apps don't need to include wx/html/msw/wxhtml.rc in resources file
  anymore. The file was removed from wxMSW


Unix ports:

! You should use `wx-config --cxxflags` in your makefiles instead of
  `wx-config --cflags` for compiling C++ files. CXXFLAGS contains CFLAGS
  and the compiler flags for C++ files only, CFLAGS should still be used
  to compile pure C files.


wxThread and related classes:

- The thread-related classes have been heavily changed since 2.2.x versions
  as the old code had many serious problems. This could have resulted in
  semantical changes other than those mentioned here, please review use of
  wxThread, wxMutex and wxCondition classes in your code.

! wxCondition now *must* be used with a mutex, please read the (updated) class
  documentation for details and revise your code accordingly: this change was
  unfortunately needed as it was impossible to ensure the correct behaviour
  (i.e. absence of race conditions) using the old API.

- wxMutex is not recursive any more in POSIX implementation (it hasn't been
  recursive in 2.2.x but was in 2.3.1 and 2.3.2), please refer to the class
  documentation for the discussion of the recursive mutexes.

- wxMutex::IsLocked() doesn't exist any more and should have never existed:
  this is was unique example of a thread-unsafe-by-design method.

Beta 1, December 24th 1998
--------------------------

wxGTK:

- Various

wxMSW, wxMotif: not in sync with this release.


Alpha 18, December 29th 1998
----------------------------

wxMSW:

- Win16 support working again (VC++ 1.5)
- Win16 now uses generic wxNotebook, wxListCtrl,
  wxTreeCtrl -- more or less working now, although
  a little work on wxNotebook is still needed.
  Under 16-bit Windows, get assertion when you click
  on a tab.
- Wrote 16-bit BC++ makefiles: samples don't yet link.
- Added CodeWarrior support to distribution courtesy
  of Stefan Csomor.

wxMotif:

- Cured scrolling problem: scrollbars now show/hide themselves
  without (permanently) resizing the window.
- Removed some commented-out lines in wxScrolledWindow::AdjustScrollbars
  that disabled scrollbar paging.
- Set background colour of drawing area in wxWindow, so e.g. wxListCtrl
  colours correctly.
- Removed major bug whereby dialogs were unmanaged automatically
  when any button was pressed.
- Fixed colours of wxWindow scrollbars, made list and text controls
  have a white background.
- Fixed dialog colour setting.
- Added settable fonts and colours for wxMenu/wxMenuBar. Now
  they have sensible colours by default.
- Fixed a bug in wxStaticBox.
- Cured wxTreeCtrl bug: now works pretty well!
- Debugged DrawEllipticArc (a ! in the wrong place).
- Added SetClippingRegion( const wxRegion& region ).
- Added wxPoint, wxSize, wxRect versions of SetSize etc.

Alpha 17, November 22nd 1998
----------------------------

wxMSW:

- More documentation updates, especially for
  wxLayoutWindow classes and debugging facilities.
- Changed wxDebugContext to use wxDebugLog instead
  of wxTrace.
- Now supports VC++ 6.0, and hopefully BC++ 5.0.
  However, DLL support may be broken for BC++ since
  VC++ 6 required changing of WXDLLEXPORT keyword
  position.
- Numerous miscellaneous changes.

wxMotif:

- Reimplemented MDI using wxNotebook instead of the MDI widgets, which
  were too buggy (probably not design for dynamic addition/removal of
  child frames).
- Some improvements to the wxNotebook implementation.
- wxToolBar now uses a bulletin board instead of a form, in an attempt
  to make it possible to add ordinary wxControls to a toolbar.
- Cured problem with not being able to use global memory operators,
  by defining two more global operators, so that the delete will match
  the debugging implementation.
- Added wxUSE_DEBUG_NEW_ALWAYS so we can distinguish between using
  global memory operators (usually OK) and #defining new to be
  WXDEBUG_NEW (sometimes it might not be OK).
- Added time.cpp to makefile; set wxUSE_DATETIME to 1.
- Added a parent-existence check to popup menu code to make it not crash.
- Added some optimization in wxWindow::SetSize to produce less flicker.
  It remains to be seen whether this produces any resize bugs.

It's a long time since I updated this file. Previously done:

- wxFrame, wxDialog done.
- wxScrolledWindow done (but backing pixmap not used at present).
- wxBitmap done though could be tidied it up at some point.
- Most basic controls are there, if not rigorously tested.
- Some MDI support (menus appear on child frames at present).
- wxNotebook almost done.
- wxToolBar done (horizontal only, which would be easy to extend
  to vertical toolbars).

More recently:

- Colour and font changing done (question mark over what happens
  to scrollbars).
- Accelerators done (for menu items and buttons). Also event loop
  tidied up in wxApp so that events are filtered through ProcessXEvent.
- wxWindow::GetUpdateRegion should now work.

Alpha 16, September 8th 1998
----------------------------

wxMSW:

- Added wxSashWindow, wxSashLayoutWindow classes, and sashtest
  sample.
- Guilhem's socket classes added, plus wxsocket sample.
- A few more makefiles added.
- GnuWin32/BC++ compatibility mods.
- Further doc updates.
- wxProp updates for correct working with wxGTK.

  wxColour, wxButton, wxCheckBox, wxTextCtrl, wxStaticText,
  wxMenu, wxMenuItem, wxMenuBar

Alpha 15, August 31st 1998
--------------------------

wxMSW:

- wxBitmap debugged.
- wxDC::GetDepth added.
- Contribution added whereby wxBitmap will be
  converted to DC depth if they don't match.
- wxConfig API improved, documentation updated.
- Printing classes name conventions cleaned up.
- wxUpdateUIEvent now derives from wxCommandEvent
  so event can travel up the window hierarchy.

Alpha 14, July 31st 1998
------------------------

wxMSW:

- Toolbar API has been simplified, and now
  wxFrame::GetClientArea returns the available client
  area when toolbar, status bar etc. have been accounted for.
  wxFrame::CreateToolBar added in line with CreateStatusBar.
- Documentation updates, incl. for wxToolBar.
- New wxAcceleratorTable class plus wxFrame::SetAcceleratorTable.
- Various additions from other folk, e.g. streams, wxConfig
  changes, wxNotebook.
- Added wxDocMDIParentFrame, wxDocMDIChildFrame for doc/view.

Alpha 13, July 8th 1998
-----------------------

wxMSW:

- Implemented wxPoint as identical to POINT on Windows, and
  altered wxDC wxPoint functions to use wxPoint directly in
  Windows functions, for efficiency.
- Cured wxASSERT bug in wxStatusBar95.
- #ifdefed out some bits in oleutils.cpp for compilers that
  don't support it.
- Added some operators to wxPoint, wxSize.
- Added inline wxDC functions using wxPoint, wxSize, wxRect.

Alpha 12, July 7th 1998
-----------------------

wxMSW:

- Added wxApp::GetComCtl32Version, and wxTB_FLAT style, so can
  have flat toolbars on Win98 or Win95 with IE >= 3 installed.

Alpha 11, July 3rd 1998
-----------------------

wxMSW:

- Added thread.h, thread.cpp.
- Changed Enabled, Checked to IsEnabled, IsChecked in wxMenu,
  wxMenuBar.
- Changed wxMenuItem::SetBackColor to SetBackgroundColour,
  SetTextColor to SetTextColour, and added or made public several
  wxMenuItem accessors.
- Added two overloads to wxRegion::Contains. Added
  wxRegion::IsEmpty for a more consistent naming convention.
- Added Vadim's wxDataObject and wxDropSource.
- ENTER/LEAVE events now work.
- Cured wxMemoryDC bug where the DC wasn't being deleted.
- Cured wxGauge SetSize major bugginess.
- Cured problem where if a GDI object was created on the stack,
  then went out of scope, then another object was selected into
  the DC, GDI objects would leak. This is because the assignment
  to e.g. wxDC::m_pen would delete the GDI object without it first
  being selected out of the DC. Cured by selecting the old DC object
  first, then doing the assignment.
- Split up wxGaugeMSW, wxGauge95, wxSliderMSW, wxSlider95
- Various other bug fixes and additions.

Generic:

- Major work on Dialog Editor (still plenty to go).
- Expanded documentation a bit more.

Alpha 10, May 7th 1998
----------------------

wxMSW:

- Added desiredWidth, desiredHeight parameters to wxBitmapHandler
  and wxIcon functions so that you can specify what size of
  icon should be loaded. Probably will remain a Windows-specific thing.
- wxStatusBar95 now works for MDI frames.
- Toolbars in MDI frames now behave normally. They still
  require application-supplied positioning code though.
- Changed installation instructions, makefiles and batch files
  for compiling with Gnu-Win32/Mingw32/EGCS. Also timercmn.cpp
  change to support Mingw32/EGCS. Bison now used by default.

------------------------

wxMSW:

- Cured bug in wxStatusBar95 that caused a crash if multiple
  fields were used.
- Added Gnu-Win32 b19/Mingw32 support by changing resource
  compilation and pragmas.
- Cured wxMenu bug introduced in alpha 8 - didn't respond to
  commands because VZ changed the id setting in wxMenu::MSWCommand.

Generic:

- Corrected some bugs, such as the wxModule compilation problem.
- Added Gnu-Win32 b19/Mingw32 support by changing resource

------------------------

wxMSW:

- Found stack error bug - stopped unwanted OnIdle recursion.
- Removed bug in wxTreeCtrl::InsertItem I added in alpha 5.
- Changed exit behaviour in wxApp/wxFrame/wxDialog. Now will
  check if the number of top-level windows is zero before

  m_topWindow or the first member of wxTopLevelWindows, so you
  don't have to call wxApp::SetTopWindow.
- Added dynarray.h/dynarray.cpp (from Vadim).
- Added first cut at OLE drag and drop (from Vadim). dnd sample
  added. Drop target only at this stage. See src/msw/ole/*.cpp,
  wx/include/msw/ole/*.h. WIN32 only because of UUID usage.
  Doesn't work with GnuWin32 - no appropriate headers e.g. for
  IUnknown.
  Doesn't work with BC++ either - crashes on program startup.
- Added Vadim's owner-draw modifications - will probably remain
  Windows-only. This enhances wxMenu, wxListBox. See ownerdrw sample.
- Added wxLB_OWNERDRAW for owner-draw listboxes.
- Vadim's wxCheckListBox derives from wxListBox. See checklst sample.
  Doesn't entirely work for WIN16.
- Vadim has added wxMenuItem as a separate file menuitem.cpp. It
  can also be used as an argument to wxMenu::Append, not just for
  internal implementation.
- Some #ifdefs done for MINGW32 compilation (just alter OPTIONS
  in makeg95.env, together with mingw32.bat). However, resource
  binding is not working yet so most apps with dialogs crash.

Generic:

- Added Vadim's dynarray.h, dynarray.cpp.
- Added Vadim's menuitem.cpp.
- Added Windows-specific wxCheckListBox,
  owner-draw wxListBox, and drag-and-drop
  (see docs/msw/changes.txt).

Alpha 5, 14th February 1998
--------------------------

wxMSW:

- GENERIC AND MSW-SPECIFIC CODE NOW TREATED AS TWO SEPARATE
  DISTRIBUTIONS. This change log will therefore now refer to
  the Windows-specific code only. See docs/changes.txt for generic
  changes.
- Removed Windows-specific reference counting system (GDI
  resources were cleaned up in idle time) - minimal
  advantages now we have a wxWin reference counting system.
- Added missing WXDLLEXPORT keywords so DLL compilation works
  again.
- Removed most warnings for GnuWin32 compilation.
- Added wxRegion/wxRegionIterator, but haven't yet used it in
  e.g. wxDC.

Generic:

- GENERIC AND MSW-SPECIFIC CODE NOW TREATED AS TWO SEPARATE
  DISTRIBUTIONS. This change log will therefore now refer to
  the generic code only. See docs/msw/changes.txt for Windows-specific
  changes.
- Readmes, change logs and installation files now go in
  platform-specific directories under docs, e.g. docs/msw,
  docs/gtk.
- Added DECLARE_APP and IMPLEMENT_APP macros so wxApp object gets
  created dynamically, not as a global object.
- Put wxColour into wx/msw/colour.h, src/msw/colour.cpp.
- Changed names of some include/wx/generic headers to be
  consistent and to conform to gcc pragma conventions. Also
  changed choicesg.cpp to choicdgg.cpp.
- Added gcc pragmas.
- Added gtk inclusion in include/wx headers.
- Added consistent file headings to source and headers.
- Removed lang.cpp, lang.h and references to wxSTR_... variables;
  added a few references to wxTransString.
- Added operator to wxTransString that converts automatically
  to wxString, so we can say e.g. wxMessageBox(wxTransString("Hello"), ...).
- samples/internat now works (minimally).
- Added wxMouseEvent::GetPosition and
  wxMouseEvent::GetLogicalPosition, both returning wxPoints.
- Made wxSize and wxRect contain longs not ints.
- Cured some memory leaks (thanks Vadim).
- Tidied up OnIdle and introduced RequestMore/MoreRequested so
  will only keep processing OnIdle if it returns TRUE from
  MoreRequested.

Alpha 4, 31st January 1998
--------------------------

All:

- Changed wxDC functions to take longs instead of floats. GetSize now takes
  integer pointers, plus a version that returns a wxSize.
- const keyword added to various wxDC functions.
- Under Windows, wxDC no longer has any knowledge of whether
  an associated window is scrolled or not. Instead, the device
  origin is set by wxScrolledWindow in wxScrolledWindow::PrepareDC.
- wxScrolledWindow applications can optionally override the virtual OnDraw
  function instead of using the OnPaint event handler. The wxDC passed to
  OnDraw will be translated by PrepareDC to reflect scrolling.
  When drawing outside of OnDraw, must call PrepareDC explicitly.
- wxToolBarBase/wxToolBarSimple similarly changed to allow for
  scrolling toolbars.
- Integrated wxPostScriptDC patches for 1.xx by Chris Breeze,
  to help printing with multiple pages.
- IPC classes given base classes (wxConnectionBase etc.) which
  define the API used by different implementations. DDE
  implementation updated to use these base classes.
- wxHelpInstance now separated into wxHelpControllerBase (base
  for all implementations), wxWinHelpController (uses standard
  WinHelp), wxXLPHelpController (talks to wxHelp by DDE or
  TCP/IP). There will be others eventually, such as
  wxHTMLHelpController for Microsoft (and Netscape?) HTML Help.
- Added Vadim Zeitlin's wxString class plus
  internationalization code (gettext simulation, wxLocale, etc.).
  New files from Vadim:
  include\wx\string.h
  include\wx\debug.h
  include\wx\file.h
  include\wx\log.h
  include\wx\intl.h
  src\common\string.cpp
  src\common\log.cpp
  src\common\intl.cpp
  src\common\file.cpp
  No longer use GNU wxString files.
- Split off file-related functions into include\wx\filefn.h and
  src\common\filefn.cpp.
- Borland C++ support (WIN32) for main library and
  samples, using makefile.b32 files.
- Preparation done for allowing BC++ to compile wxWin as a DLL,
  including changes to defs.h.
- wxIntPoint removed, wxPoint is now int, and wxRealPoint
  introduced.
- Added wxShowEvent (generated when window is being shown or
  hidden).
- Got minimal, docview, mdi samples working for 16-bit VC++ and
  cured 16-bit problem with wxTextCtrl (removed global memory
  trick).
- Updated GnuWin32 makefiles, checked minimal, mdi, docview samples.

Alpha 3, September 1997
-----------------------

All:

- wxListCtrl, wxTreeCtrl, wxImageList classes done.
- Instigated new file hierarchy, split files and classes up more logically.
- PrologIO and some other utils now put into core library.
- Revamped print/preview classes, added wxPageSetupDialog.
- Started documentation.

Alpha 2, 30th April 1997
------------------------

All:

- EVT_... macros now have at least one argument, for conformance
  with MetroWerks compiler.
- Added ids to .wxr file format.
- Got Dialog Editor compiled and running again but need
  to extend functionality to be in line with new controls.
  Added dialoged\test app to allow dynamic loading of .wxr files
  for testing purposes.
- Rewrote wxBitmap to allow installable file type
  handlers.
- Rewrote wxBitmapButton, wxStaticBitmap to not use Fafa.
- Wrote most of wxTreeCtrl and sample (need wxImageList to implement it
  fully).
- Added back wxRadioBox.
- Tidied up wx_main.cpp, wxApp class, putting PenWin code in
  a separate file.

Alpha 1, 5th April 1997
-----------------------

Generic:

At this point, the following has been achieved:

- A lot, but not all, of the code has been revamped for better
  naming conventions, protection of data members, and use of
  wxString instead of char *.
- Obsolete functionality deleted (e.g. default wxPanel layout,
  old system event system) and code size reduced.
- Class hierarchy changed (see design doc) - base classes such
  as wxbWindow now removed.
- No longer includes windows.h in wxWin headers, by using stand-in
  Windows types where needed e.g. WXHWND.
- PrologIO revised.
- wxScrolledWindow, wxStatusBar and new MDI classes added.
  MDI is now achieved using separate classes, not window styles.
- wxSystemSettings added, and made use of to reflect standard
  Windows settings.
- SetButtonFont/SetLabelFont replaced by SetFont; font and colour
  settings mucho rationalised.
- All windows are now subclassed with the same window proc to make
  event handling far more consistent. Old internal wxWnd and derived
  classes removed.
- API for controls revised, in particular addition of
  wxValidator parameters and removal of labels for some controls.
- 1 validator written: see examples/validate.
- Event table system introduced (see most samples and
  wx_event.cpp/ProcessEvent, wx_event.h). wxEvtHandler
  made more flexible, with Push/PopEventHandler allowing a chain
  of event handlers.
- wxRadioBox removed - will be added back soon.
- Toolbar class hierarchy revised:
  wxToolBarBase
  wxToolBarSimple (= old wxToolBar)
  wxToolBar95 (= old wxButtonBar under Win95)
  wxToolBarMSW (= old wxButtonBar under WIN16/WIN32)
- Constraint system debugged somewhat (sizers now work properly).
- wxFileDialog, wxDirDialog added; other common dialogs now
  have class equivalents. Generic colour and font dialogs
  rewritten to not need obsolete panel layout.
- .wxr resource system partially reinstated, though needs
  an integer ID for controls. Hopefully the resource system
  will be replaced by something better and more efficient
  in the future.
- Device contexts no longer stored with window and accessed
  with GetDC - use wxClientDC, wxPaintDC, wxWindowDC stack
  variables instead.
- wxSlider uses trackbar class under Win95, and wxSL_LABELS flag
  determines whether labels are shown. Other Win95-specific flags
  introduced, e.g. for showing ticks.
- Styles introduced for dealing with 3D effects per window, for
  any window: all Win95 3D effects supported, plus transparent windows.
- Major change to allow 3D effect support without CTL3D, under
  Win95.
- Bitmap versions of button and checkbox separated out into new
  classes, but unimplemented as yet because I intend to remove
  the need for Fafa - it apparently causes GPFs in Win95 OSR 2.
- utils/wxprop classes working (except maybe wxPropertyFormView)
  in preparation for use in Dialog Editor.
- GNU-WIN32 compilation verified (a month or so ago).
