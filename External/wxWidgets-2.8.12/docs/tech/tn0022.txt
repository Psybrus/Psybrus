                  Working with the the wxWidgets release system
                    =====================================

Currently, to generate the release tarballs, wxWidgets uses a script which 
reads from a series of manifest files to determine which files should be
installed for a particular port. This document explains how to alter the list 
of files that are distributed in the release tarballs.

The scripts are located in the <wxWidgets root>/distrib/scripts folder, with 
create_archives.sh doing most of the work to create the actual tarballs. 
pre-flight.sh runs the entire process of doing a checkout, building the releases, 
and putting them into the <wxWidgets root>/deliver folder. The manifest files
are located in the <wxWidgets root>/distrib/scripts/manifests folder and
they have a .rsp extension for historical reasons.


Adding/removing a file from releases
------------------------------------

First, you must decide which tarballs you'd like to make the change to, in 
order to determine which manifest file(s) the file should appear in.

Below is a list of each port and the primary manifest files that are used to 
generate that release. The "ALL" in the list is not for wxALL, it means that
those manifests are where things that go in all ports should be.

tarball     primary manifests
-------     ----------------
ALL         generic.rsp
wxBase      base.rsp
wxMSW       msw.rsp, wince.rsp
wxOS2       os2.rsp
wxGTK       gtk.rsp
wxMAC       mac.rsp cocoa.rsp
wxMotif     motif.rsp
wxMGL       mgl.rsp
wxX11       x11.rsp
       
Once you've decided which manifest file is most appropriate to add your file
in, then open that manifest and add a line with your file(s) at the bottom.
The file(s) should give the path relative to the wxWidgets root directory,
like so:

At the current time, wildcards in filenames are also accepted. Once the files are
added, they should show up in releases when distrib/scripts/pre-flight.sh is run.
