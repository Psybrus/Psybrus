<h3><a name="wxgtk">What is wxWidgets for GTK?</a></h3>

wxWidgets for GTK is a port of wxWidgets to the <a href="http://www.gimp.org/gtk" target=_top>GTK+ toolkit</a>,
which is freely available for most flavours of Unix with X. wxWidgets for GTK is
often abbreviated to wxGTK. wxGTK has a separate home page <a href="http://www.freiburg.linux.de/~wxxt" target=_top>here</a>.

<h3><a name="locale">Why doesn&#39;t reading floating point numbers work when using wxWidgets?</a></h3>

If your program reads the floating point numbers in the format <tt>123.45</tt>
from a file, it may suddenly start returning just <tt>123</tt> instead of the
correct value on some systems -- which is all the more mysterious as the same
code in a standalone program works just fine.

<p>
The explanation is that GTK+ changes the current locale on program startup. If
the decimal point character in the current locale is not the period (for
example, it is comma in the French locale), all the standard C functions won&#39;t
recognize the numbers such as above as floating point ones any more.

<p>
The solution is to either use your own function for reading the floating point
numbers (probably the best one) or to call <tt>setlocale(LC_NUMERIC, "C")</tt>
before reading from file and restore the old locale back afterwards if needed.

<h3><a name="gnome">Does wxGTK have GNOME support?</a></h3>

Currently wxGTK does not have any features that would involve dependence on any desktop
environment&#39;s libraries, so it can work on GNOME, KDE and with other window managers
without installation hassles. Some GNOME and KDE integration features are file based, and
so may be added without dependence on libraries. Other features may be supported in the
future, probably as a separate library.
<P>

<h3><a name="redhat">Warning about GTK+ libraries supplied with RedHat</a></h3>

It seems that some versions of RedHat include a badly patched version of GTK+ (not wxGTK)
which causes some trouble with wxWidgets&#39; socket code. Common symptoms are that when
a client tries to establish a connection to an existing server which refuses the request,
the client will get notified twice, first getting a LOST event and then a CONNECT event.
This problem can be solved by updating GTK with an official distribution of the library.

<h3><a name="bincompat">What range of Intel Linux platforms will a given application binary be usable on?</h3>

Robert Roebling replies:<P>

&#34;The important thing is the libc version that your app
is linked against. The most recent version is 2.2.5
and programs linked against it will not run with version
2.1.X so that you will fare best if you compile your app
on a 2.1.X system. It will then run on practically all
Linux distros (if you link you app statically against
the image libraries and std C++ lib).&#34;
<P>

<h3><a name="#static">Can I statically link the GTK+ library?</a></h3>

No, this is not possible. It leads to crashes in GTK+.
<P>

<h3><a name="#charinframe">Why does my simple program using
<tt>EVT_CHAR</tt> not work?</a></h3>

In wxGTK, the frames never get focus and so can never receive <tt>CHAR</tt>
nor <tt>KEY</tt> events so an <tt>EVT_CHAR</tt> handler for a frame will be
never called. To receive these events, you should create a <tt>wxPanel</tt>
inside the frame and register the key event handlers for the panel, not the
frame.

<p>

<h3><a name="#debugging">How do I trace the cause of an X11 error such as BadMatch?</h3>

When a fatal X11 error occurs, the application quits with no stack trace.
To find out where the problem is, put a breakpoint on g_log (<tt>b g_log</tt>
in gdb).
