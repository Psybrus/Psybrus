January 18, 1999, V2.50:
	* Added autoconf/automake/libtool support
	* Licensing moved to LGPL 
	* Added OpenLink code enhancements and bug fixes

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Original Changelog from Ke Jin
------------------------------------------------------------------------
July 30, 1995, v2.00.beta: 
	0. the first release and beta version. 

Sep. 11, 1995, v2.10:
	1. Porting to AIX 3.x and 4.x, by writing dlopen(),
	   dlsym(), dlclose() interface. 
	2. Tested on SCO OpenServer 5.x 
	3. Awared of that, unlike s700/s800, exported function 
	   symbols on HP9000 s300/s400 will be prepended with 
	   a '_' prefix by compiler(and this '_' prefix is not
	   automatically handled by shl_findsym()). Now, it works
	   fine on s300/s400.
	4. Support driver ODBC call tracing.

Oct. 12, 1995, v2.11:
	5. Driver's SQLNumResultCols() will automatically be 
	   invoked in driver manager's SQLExecute(),
	   SQLExecDirect() and SQLParamData() after successfully 
	   (i.e. return SQL_SUCCESS or SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO )
	   calling of their correspondent driver functions. This 
	   simplifies the state tracing/checking of the driver 
	   manager a lot and allows store procedures to return 
	   result set and also make iODBC driver manager work 
	   properly with SELECT INTO statements which actually 
	   don't return result sets.
	6. Memory leaks are cleared.
	7. Two bugs in dld.c for AIX are fixed 
	8. A bug of setting tracing option is fixed.
	9. The driver will not be unloaded by SQLDisconnect() 
	   but by SQLFreeConnect() or next SQLConnect()/
	   SQLDriverConnect()/SQLBrowsConnect() on a different 
	   driver. This will save driver's loading time if it
	   has been used by a previous connection(even there
	   is no active connection on this driver).
	10.Another three platforms are supported:
		FreeBSD			2.x 
		Concurrent Max/OS SVR4	1.x
		DG/UX			5.x
	11.autoconfig and build -- shell scripts to help modifying 
	   Config.mk and building iodbc driver manager

Nov. 12, 1995, v2.12
	12.I realized that a driver manager doesn't aware of 
	   difference between a C5 (i.e. hstmt) and a C6 
	   (i.e. transaction) states. 
	13.The link flags "-lc" has been droped from Linux ELF
	   section of Config.mk to fix a segment fault problem.
	   Now, it works fine on Slackware 2.3 and Red Hat 2.0
	   (kernel version are 1.2.xx and 1.3.xx respectively).
	14.On FreeBSD 2.x, dlsym() doesn't handle the '_' prefix 
	   prepended to an exportting function symbol by compiler. 
	   So, CLI_NAME_PREFIX needs to be defined as "_SQL" for 
	   FreeBSD 2.x. 
	15.Some files are renamed
		dld.c	-> dlf.c
		dld.h	-> dlf.h
		confg.h -> config.h
	16. Fix a bug on setting tracing options.
