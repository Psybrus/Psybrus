			 Vector math library


* Overview

  The Vector math library provides 3-D/4-D vector operations including
  addition, outer product, multiply by a matrix, etc.


* License

  This library is licensed under the terms in the file 'LICENSE' in
  this directory.


* Installing

  To install this library, run following commands:

  - PowerPC with VMX (fully supported)

    $ make ARCH=ppu install

  - SPU (Cell Broadband Engine Synergistic Processor Unit)

    $ make ARCH=spu install

  - x86 with SSE (partially supported)

    $ make ARCH=SSE install

  - Other architectures (partially supported)

    $ make install


  By default, files in the library will be placed as below:

  - headers
  
    /usr/include/vectormath/c/       (C headers)
    /usr/include/vectormath/cpp/     (C++ headers)

  - SPU headers
  
    /usr/spu/include/vectormath/c/   (C headers)
    /usr/spu/include/vectormath/cpp/ (C++ headers)

  No shared library, static library nor executable is installed,
  because all functions in this library are provided as inline
  functions.


* Packaging

  By running following command in this directory, a source tarball
  'vectormath-<VERSION>.tar.gz' can be created:

    $ make dist
  
  You can also create RPM packages by executing the command below with
  the tarball:

    $ rpmbuild -tb vectormath-1.0.1.tar.gz --target=ppc

  One or two packages, vectormath-devel (and, in addition,
  spu-vectormath-devel for PowerPC target), will be created.


* Usage

  See the documents `doc/*.pdf'.
