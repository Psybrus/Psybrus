libb64: Base64 Encoding/Decoding Routines
======================================

## Changelog ##

Version 1.2 Release
-------------------
Removed the b64dec, b64enc, encoder and decoder programs in favour of
a better example, called base64, which encodes and decodes 
depending on its arguments.

Created a solution for Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Express 2010
edition, which simply builds the base64 example as a console application.

Version 1.1 Release
-------------------
Modified encode.h to (correctly) read from the iostream argument,
instead of std::cin.
Thanks to Peter K. Lee for the heads-up.

No API changes.

Version 1.0 Release
-------------------
The current content is the changeset.
