    wxPropertyGrid is a specialized grid for editing properties such as strings,
    numbers, flagsets, fonts, and colours. wxPropertySheet used to do the very
    same thing, but it hasn't been updated for a while and it is currently
    deprecated.


  HOW TO INSTALL AND BUILD
  ------------------------

    * WINDOWS

  Run installer or unpack .tar.gz source archive.

  Set WXWIN environment variable to the wxWidgets source directory, if you
  have not done this already.

  wxWidgets 2.8.x:

  Makefiles and project files to use directly are located in propgrid/build.
  You need to tell the compiler the type of wx build to use with WX_DEBUG=0/1,
  WX_UNICODE=0/1, and WX_SHARED=0/1.
  
  For instance, this builds unicode dll release with msvc:

  nmake -f makefile.vc WX_DEBUG=0 WX_UNICODE=1 WX_SHARED=1

  NOTES for wxWidgets 2.6.x only:
  
  You must use makefiles and project files in build_wx26. Also, Make sure your
  wxWidgets codebase has been patched with refcounted wxVariant (see patch_wx26
  directory).


  NOTES for wxWidgets SVN trunk/2.9+:

  wxPropertyGrid is already part of wxWidgets 2.9 and later. Attempt to use
  this separate component unmodified will result in compilation failures.


    * POSIX SYSTEMS (LINUX, MAC OS X, MINGW+MSYS, etc.)

  First make sure you have done 'make install' for your wxWidgets build.
  Then the usual configure && make && make install proccess can ensue.

  For instance:

  tar zxf wxpropgrid-1.4.15-src.tar.gz
  cd propgrid
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

  You may also need to add lib dir to the lists of library paths (e.g. by using
  ldconfig under Linux).

  NOTE: If static linking of the sample app fails, you may need to manually
        fix the order of libraries of WX_LIBS variable in the Makefile
        generated by the configure script.

  wxWidgets 2.6.x only:
  
  Make sure your wxWidgets codebase has been patched with refcounted wxVariant
  (see patch_wx26 directory).
