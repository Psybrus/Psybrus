Description: This is a sample implementation of the autopatcher server. It's actually complete enough to use if you wish.

Dependencies: PostgreSQL version 8.2 (http://www.postgresql.org/download/). Dlls should exist with the .exe. See the post-build process which copies "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\8.2\bin\*.dll" .\Release
