This sample demonstrate the usage of RakVoice with FMOD. The RakVoice class is a wrapper encodes input data using speex (http://www.speex.org/), sends it as a packet using Raknet, and decodes it using Speex.
A reusable class (FMODVoiceAdapter) is provided in this example, to connect RakVoice with FMOD.

NOTES:
 - FMOD version 4.04.XX was used to create this sample.
 - This project expects to find FMOD headers and lib in the default direcory, which is "C:\Program Files\FMOD SoundSystem\FMOD Programmers API".
If you have FMOD installed in a different directory, you'll need to edit the project's properties.
 - FMOD's DLL (fmodex.dll), is expected to be found in the executable directory, if running outside the IDE, or in the directory you accessed this file, if running from inside the IDE.

See SpeexLicense.txt for the license agreement of Speex.
You should also read FMOD's license.
