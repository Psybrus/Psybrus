/// \brief Connection between DirectSound and RakVoice
///

/*
This sample uses RakVoice along with DirectSound 8.

Instead of using IDirectSoundBuffer::GetCurrentPosition / IDirectSoundCaptureBuffer::GetCurrentPosition
to keep track of the play/write cursors, notifications are used instead.
Speex encodes/decodes sound in blocks (frames), so the size of the used DirectSound buffers is
multiple of the Speex's frame size. This makes it easier to implement DirectSound notifications at the end
of each frame.
