  <H1>The UDT Congestion Control Algorithm</H1>

  <H1>OVERVIEW</H1>
  <p>UDT uses an AIMD (additive increase  multiplicative decrease) style congestion control algorithm. The  algorithm controls the sending rate by tuning the packet sending  period (i.e. how often to send out one packet). This period is  presented by the symbol <strong>SND </strong>in the rest of this document. The  sending rate is increased every 10 milliseconds according to Section  3 if and only if at least one acknowledgement (ACK) has been received  since the last rate increase. The rate will be decreased according to  Section 4 upon receiving a packet loss report (negative  acknowledgement, or NAK). The rate may or may not be decreased on a  timeout event, see Section 5.</p>
  
  <p>Note that the packet sending period is  different from the inter-packet time. The former includes the time  that is required to send out a packet, which can be significant in  high speed networks. The latter does not include the packet sending  time.</p>
  
  <p>UDT also uses a supportive window-based  control by tuning the maximum number of on-flight packets  (unacknowledged packets) (<strong>CWND</strong>). An upper threshold of CWND  should be used and set as large enough to not limit throughput. A  lower threshold should be set as well to avoid deadlock (CWND cannot  be 0). In UDT, the lower threshold is 2. The CWND value is updated  when an ACK is received.</p>
  
  <p>The congestion control includes two  phases: it starts with a slow start phase and then enters then  regular phase as described above. The slow start phase runs exactly  once at the beginning of a connection and stops when a packet loss  occurs or CWND reaches its maximum value.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Implementation Note 1.1</strong>:  Initially, SND is set at 0 and CWND is set at 2.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Implementation Note 1.2</strong>: When  necessary, the packet sending interval does not need to be strictly  enforced. The sender can sends out a group of packets and then sleeps  an aggregate amount of inter-packet time. For example, if SND = 10ms,  the sender can sends out 10 packets continuously and sleep 100ms  minus the time used to send out those 10 packets. This is especially  important as most operating systems have a minimum sleep time (e.g.,  10ms).</p>
  
  <p><strong>Implementation Note 1.3</strong>: The  window control is independent of flow control. However, they can be  enforced at the same place in the sender. The sender should stop  sending once the number of the on-flight packets reaches either the  congestion window size or the flow window size, until a new ACK  comes.</p>
  
  <H1>PRELIMINARY</H1>
  <H2>ASSUMPTIONS</H2>
  <p>UDT assumes most of packets have the  same size. If this assumption does not hold, the unit &ldquo;packets per  second&rdquo; in the rest of the paper should be converted to bits per  second.</p>
  
  <p>UDT increases its sending rate every 10  milliseconds, this constant time is defined as <strong>SYN</strong>. At least  one ACK should be sent back every SYN, provided that there are data  packets received.</p>
  
  <H2>Packet Pair Technique</H2>
  <p>UDT requires an estimated value of the  link capacity. This is done by using a packet pair technique. In this  technique, the sender sends two back-to-back packets of the same  size. Once these two packets arrive at the receiver side, there will  be an interval between the two packets. The link capacity can then be  determined by</p>
  
  <p> B = packet size / interval</p>
  
  <p>UDT sends out a packet pair every 16  packets. However, when it happens that there is no 17th packet to be  sent out, UDT will still send out the 16th packet, rather than  waiting for the next one. In this case, there will be a bigger  interval (hence underestimation) at the receiver side. The receiver  should use a median filter to detect and discard such values.</p>
  
  <p>In addition, other patterns of packet  pairs can be used, as long as the receiver has a way to identify the  packet pairs.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Implementation Note 2.1</strong>: All  packets in the packet pairs should have the same size. The ideal  packet size used in packet pair should be the path MTU size  (including all packet headers). If this is not possible, the size  should be as close to the MTU size as possible. However, the size  must not be bigger than MTU.</p>
  
  <p>Because UDT was designed for  transferring big data, there should be always enough MTU-sized  packets to use. In certain situations where most packets are small  ones, those packets can still be used for packet pair estimation,  although overestimation may be caused, depending on how small the  packets are. In addition, if the packets are sent out very  frequently, they can be combined into bigger ones. If the packets are  sent less frequently, then they are not likely to cause any  congestion (hence the congestion control may not be necessarily  strictly enforced).</p>
  
  <p>If the sizes of the packets are too  small or the two packets have different sizes, this packet pair  should be ignored. The receiver keeps a window of the last <em>N</em> packet pairs. The value <em>N</em> can be any proper number as long as  it can reach a reasonable estimation, and it should not be too large  to consume too much memory and CPU time. In UDT, <em>N</em> = 64.</p>
  
  <p>Here the data structure &ldquo;window&rdquo; is  a circular linked list with a fixed size of <em>N</em>. However, it  does not matter how it is implemented, as long as it can store a list  of historical values and uses the most recent value to replace the  oldest value each time.</p>
  
  <p>The receiver should use a median filter  to filter out noises. UDT computes a median value of the intervals  kept in the window. All values greater than 8x of the median or less  than 1/8 of the median should be ignored. UDT then computes the  average of the rest intervals. The link capacity will then be  calculated using the average interval.</p>
  
  <p> B = packet size / average_interval</p>
  
  <p>Note that this formula is based on the  assumption that most packets have the same size. If this assumption  does not hold, B should be computed from each pair independently and  then the average B is calculated.</p>
  
  <p>The window should be filled with very  large intervals (i.e., low bandwidth, for safety purpose) initially.  UDT uses 1 second.</p>
  
  <p>The estimation is done at the receiver  side. The receiver should send this value back to the sender. This  can be carried by any proper control packets. UDT carries the  estimation value in every ACK.</p>
  
  <p>The sender, upon receiving a new value,  should use a smooth average to update its own value:</p>
  
  <p> B = B * 0.875 + b * 0.125</p>
  
  <p>where B is the link capacity value that  the sender maintains and b is the value that is just sent back by the  receiver.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Note 2.1:</strong> Accuracy of the packet  pair technique may depend on the network equipments and network  congestion. Both overestimation and underestimation can happen.  However, the rate increase formula in Section 3 can tolerate  misestimation to a scale up to 10x or 1/10 of the real link capacity.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Implementation Note 2.2</strong>: The  link capacity value B can be sent only with selected ACKs (e.g.,  every 10 ACKs or every 10ms). It depends on how often an ACK is  generated. Calculating B is time consuming, so some ACKs can be  skipped if ACKs are sent very often. This principle applies to the  packet arrival rate (AS) as well, see Section 2.4.</p>
  
  <H2>RTT and RTO</H2>
  <p>UDT needs to update RTT (Round Trip  Time) and RTO (Retransmission Time Out). UDT sends one ACK2  (acknowledgement of acknowledgement) for selective ACK. The receiver  records the time when an ACK is sent out. The ACK carries a unique  sequence number (independent of the data packet sequence number). The  corresponding ACK2 also carries the same sequence number. This  technique is called ACK sub-sequencing.</p>
  
  <p>Upon receiving the ACK2, UDT calculates  the RTT by comparing the difference between the ACK2 arrival time and  the ACK departure time. In the following formula, &ldquo;RTT&rdquo; is the  current value that the receiver maintains and &ldquo;rtt&rdquo; is the recent  value that was just calculated from ACK/ACK2.</p>
  
  <p><em>RTT = RTT *  0.875 + rtt * 0.125</em></p>
  <p><em>RTTVar = RTTVar  * 0.875 + abs(RTT - rtt)) * 0.125</em></p>
  
  <p>The RTT value should be sent back to  the sender, e.g., in ACK. UDT does not transmit RTTVar to the peer  side. The peer side will update its own RTT and RTTVar values using  the same formulae as above, in which case &ldquo;rtt&rdquo; is the most  recent value it receives, e.g., carried by an incoming ACK.</p>
  
  <p>Both RTT and RTTVar are changing  variables. RTT is not a fixed value. It can be changed by congestion  or even route change. RTTVar records the variance of the RTT value  and is required to compute RTO:</p>
  
  <p><em>RTO = RTT + 4 *  RTTVar</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>Note 2.2: </strong>A UDT socket can both  send and receive. RTT, RTTVar, and RTO are not just sender specific  variables. They are shared by both the sender and the receiver (of  the same socket). When a UDT socket receives data, it updates its  local RTT and RTTVar, which can be used for its own sender as well.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Implementation Note 2.3</strong>: There  is no need to calculate RTT and RTTVar in the same way as UDT does.  If a protocol acknowledges immediately after receiving a data packet,  RTT can be calculated by the difference between the ACK arrival time  and the departure time of the corresponding data packet. In this  case, there is no need to send ACK2.</p>
  
  <p>RTO is the time that an acknowledgement  is expected after a data packet is sent out. If there is no  acknowledgement after this amount of time elapsed, a timeout event  should be triggered.</p>
  <p>Since UDT only acknowledges every SYN  time, in UDT</p>
  
  <p><em>RTO = RTT + 4 *  RTTVar + SYN</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>Implementation Note 2.4:</strong> It is  important to have a lower threshold for RTO. If RTO is too small,  retransmission can be easily triggered by a busy CPU, etc. UDT uses  100ms as the lower threshold.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Implementation Note 2.5: </strong>Continuous  timeout should increase the RTO value. In UDT, a counter (ExpCount)  is used to track the number of continuous timeout.</p>
  
  <p><em> RTO = ExpCount * (RTT + 4 * RTTVar)  + SYN</em></p>
  
  <H2>Packet Arrival Rate</H2>
  <p>The receiver records the intervals  between any two adjacent data packet arrivals. The number of interval  values can be limited by a window size. The packet arrival rate can  be calculated by </p>
  
  <p>AS = 1 /  average_interval</p>
  
  <p>The average packet arrival interval  also requires a media filter, similar to that in Section 2.2. The  thresholds are the same as those used for B (link capacity): 8x for  upper threshold and 1/8 for lower threshold. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Implementation Note 2.6: </strong>Similar  to the estimated bandwidth, if most of the data packets are less than  MTU, the arrival rate can be computed as bits per second, rather than  number of packets per second.</p>
  
  <H1>WHEN AN ACK COMES</H1>
  <p><strong>This event and only this event can  trigger the increase of a packet sending rate (or reduce packet  sending period SND) and the updated of the size of the congestion  window (CWND).</strong></p>
  
  <p>The congestion control is in the slow  start phase initially. Within the slow start phase, the packet  sending period (SND) is 0. The window size starts at 2 and is set to  the number of total sent packets so far every time an ACK comes.</p>
  
  <p>Slow start phase stops upon receiving  an NAK or the maximum size of the window has been reached. CWND has  an upper threshold (&ldquo;maximum size of the window&rdquo;). This upper  threshold is used for safety purpose (even if there is no packet  loss, the slow start phase has to stop at a certain point). The  threshold can be set to the maximum of the receiver buffer size.</p>
  
  <p>At the end of the slow start phase, the  packet interval should be set to the reverse of the packet arrival  rate:</p>
  
  <p> SND = 1/ AS</p>
  
  <p>There is nothing else to do during the  slow start phase. The slow start phase will only run exact once at  the beginning of a connection.</p>
  
  <p>In the regular phase (post slow start),  the rate increase can be defined according to the following formulae:</p>
  
  <p>First, the number of sent packets to be  increased in the next SYN period (inc) is calculated as:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> <em> if (B &lt;= C)</em></p>
  <p> <em>inc = 1/MSS;</em></p>
  <p><em>else</em></p>
  <p> <em>inc = max(10^(ceil(log10((B-C)*MSS*8))) * Beta/MSS, 1/MSS);</em></p>
  
  <p>where B is the estimated link capacity  sent back by the receiver (Section 2.2) and C is the current sending  speed (C = 1/SND) . Both are counted as packets per second. MSS is  the fixed/maximum size of UDT packet counted in bytes, usually MSS =  MTU &ndash; UDP/UDT packet header size. Beta is a constant value of  0.0000015.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Note 3.1</strong>: If B and C use bits  per second as the unit, &ldquo;MSS&rdquo; should be removed from the  (B-C)*MSS part. This can be helpful if most of the packets are less  than MTU size.</p>
  
  <p>The SND value is the updated as:</p>
  
  <p><em>SND = (SND *  SYN) / (SND * inc + SYN).</em></p>
  
  <p>Meanwhile, the congestion window size  should be updated by:</p>
  
  <p><em>CWND = AS * (RTT  + SYN) + 16</em></p>
  
  <p>where AS is the packet arrival rate  sent back by the receiver (Section 2.4).</p>
  
  <p><strong>During the regular phase, sending  rate cannot be increased more than once during any SYN time. </strong>Meanwhile, although CWND can be updated for all ACKs, it is  usually updated together with SND.</p>
  
  <H1>WHEN AN NAK COMES</H1>
  <H2>Congestion Period</H2>
  <p>Every time an NAK is received, UDT  updates the largest sequence number has been sent so far  (LastDecSeq). We define a congestion period as the time between two  NAKs in which the biggest lost packet sequence number carried in the  NAK is greater than the LastDecSeq.</p>
  
  <p>For example, if the sender has sent out  packets 1 &ndash; 100 and an NAK comes informing the sender that packet  60 is missing, the LastDecSeq value should be updated as 100. If  after a while, another NAKs comes indicating that packet 140 is lost,  this NAK starts a new congestion period, which lasts until the next  period starts.</p>
  
  <p>Note that one congestion period can  cause multiple packet loss events. For example, if the sender sends  out packet 1 &ndash; 100, packets 60 and 80 are lost. When the sender  receives NAK(60), a new congestion period is started, and the sender  updates LastDecSeq as 100. When the sender receives NAK(80), which is  less than LastDecSeq(100), so the sender knows that it already  decreased the sending rate before (at NAK-60) and it may decrease  less for this packet loss (UDT uses a random process to decide how  much to decrease).</p>
  
  <p>After the sender decreases the sending  rate at NAK(60) or possibly NAK(80), it continues to send out new  packets 101, 102, etc. For example, when it receives an NAK(140),  which is greater than LastDecSeq(100), this means that the current  sending rate is still too high: packets sent after a rate decrease  still got dropped.</p>
  
  <H2>Decreasing Sending Rate</H2>
  <p>These four parameters are used in rate  decrease, and their initial values are in the parentheses: AvgNAKNum  (1), NAKCount (1), DecCount(0), LastDecSeq (initial sequence number -  1).</p>
  
  <p>AvgNAKNum is the average number of NAKs  during a congestion period. NAKCount is the number of NAKs received  so far in the current congestion period. DecCount means the number of  times that the sending rate has been decreased during the congestion  period.</p>
  
  <p><em>If it is in the  slow start phase, set SND to 1/AS. Slow start ends. Stop.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>If this NAK  starts a new congestion period</em></p>
  <p><em>{</em></p>
  <p> <em>increase SND = SND * 1.125;</em></p>
  <p> <em>Update AvgNAKNum;</em></p>
  <p> <em>Reset NAKCount to 1;</em></p>
  <p><em>Compute DecRandom  to a random (uniform distribution) number between 1 and AvgNAKNum;</em></p>
  <p> <em>Reset DecCount to 1;</em></p>
  <p> <em>Reset Update LastDecSeq;</em></p>
  <p> <em>Stop.</em></p>
  <p><em>}</em></p>
  
  <p><em>If (DecCount &lt;=  5) and (NAKCount == DecCount * DecRandom)</em></p>
  <p><em>{</em></p>
  <p> <em>Update SND period: SND = SND * 1.125;</em></p>
  <p> <em>Increase DecCount by 1;</em></p>
  <p><em>}</em></p>
  
  <p><em>Update  LastDecSeq and NAKCount.</em></p>
  
  <p>UDT decreases the sending rate for each  congestion period by a random factor between 1/8 to 1/2. For the  first NAK in the congestion period, UDT decreases its sending rate by  1/8 (SND = SND * 1.125). For the following NAKs, UDT uses a random  number (DecRandom) to decide if the rate should be decreased or not.  DecRandom is a random number between 1 and the average number of NAKs  per congestion period (AvgNAKNum).</p>
  
  <p>For example, if DecRandom = 2, then UDT  will decrease its sending rate on the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, &hellip; NAKs.  However, the sending rate should not be decreased by more than 1/2 in  each congestion period, so UDT will stop decreasing after the 6th  decrease (DecCount &lt;= 5), as 1.125^6 = 2.</p>
  
  <H1>RETRANSMISSION</H1>
  <p>The expiration of the RTO timer can  trigger the transmission of packets sending and may decrease of the  sending rate as well. Note that RTO is NOT set per packet/message; it  is a system timer and it is reset by every ACK and NAK.</p>
  
  <p>In UDT 4.4, the sending rate is  unchanged. In UDT 4.5, the sending rate is halved (SND = SND * 2).  The latter is recommended now because it is safer for low bandwidth  networks.</p>
  
  <p>Because RTO is actually greater than  RTT (Section 2.3), there should not be more than one timeout per RTT.</p>
  
  <p>Finally, after the aggregate continuous  timeouts exceeds a threshold, the connection should be deemed to be  broken.</p></td>
