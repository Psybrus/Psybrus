  <p>Messages from the network engine
    <BR>
    <BR>
    
      Certain packets that you get will not be from your code, using your defined types, but are instead from the network engine. However, you have to know what they are to handle them properly.  The first byte of each packet that originated from the API will map to one of the following enumerations. Possible recipient systems are in brackets. To convert these enumerations to a string, use PacketLogger::BaseIDTOString() </p>
