    </span><BR>
    <BR>
    
    Statistical data is important for an online game because it lets you see where your traffic bottlenecks are.  To this end, Raknet provides the structure RakNetStatistics which is returned by the GetStatistics() function present in RakPeerInterface.  This structure is defined in <I>Source/RakNetStatistics.h</I>.  The function StatisticsToString is also provided which will convert these statistics to a formatted buffer.<BR>
