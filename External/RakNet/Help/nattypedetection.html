    <a 
href="http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/raknet/manual/natpunchthrough.html">NAT
 punchthrough</a> success rates is based on what kind of algorithm the 
NAT uses.</p>
	  <p><strong>Full cone NAT</strong>: Accepts any datagrams to a port 
that has been previously used. Will accept the first datagram from the 
remote peer.</p>
      <p><strong>Address-Restricted cone NAT</strong>: Accepts datagrams
 to a port as long as the datagram source IP address is a system we have
 already sent to. Will accept the first datagram if both systems send 
simultaneously. Otherwise, will accept the first datagram after we have 
sent one datagram.</p>
      <p><strong>Port-Restricted cone NAT</strong>: Same as 
address-restricted cone NAT, but we had to send to both the correct 
remote IP address and correct remote port. The same source address and 
port to a different destination uses the same mapping.</p>
      <p><strong>Symmetric NAT</strong>: A different port is chosen for 
every remote destination. The same source address and port to a 
different destination uses a different mapping. Since the port will be 
different, the first external punchthrough attempt will fail. For this 
to work it requires  port-prediction (MAX_PREDICTIVE_PORT_RANGE&gt;1) 
and that the router chooses ports sequentially.</p>

<p>The NatTypeDetection plugins allow you to determine which type of NAT
 you have, and therefore if NAT punchthrough is likely to complete or 
not. This can be determined in advance of joining a game.</p>
<p><span class="RakNetBlueHeader">NAT Type Detection algorithm</span></p>
<ol>
  <li>Client opens two ports on the same IP address. In NatTypeDetectionClient, the RakNet socket is the first port, c2 is the socket on the second port, created in NatTypeDetectionClient::DetectNATType()</li>
  <li>Server opens two ports on one IP address, and one port on three 
additional IP addresses. This is done in NatTypeDetectionServer::Startup(). The first port on the first IP address is the normal RakNet socket. The second port on the first IP address is s1p2. The other three addresses are bound to the sockets s2p3, s3p4, and s4p5.</li>
  <li>Client connects to the server on the first IP address normally</li>
  <li>Client requests NAT type detection begins</li>
  <li>Server attempts to send to client's second port. This was a port that was never opened previously on the client, therefore if received, then
 the client is not behind a NAT. This is done in NatTypeDetectionServer::Update(), defined by STATE_TESTING_NONE_1 and STATE_TESTING_NONE_2. The reason for 2 attempts is that every attempt occurs twice. The time for each attempt is the ping * 3 + 50 milliseconds. s4p5 is used for this.</li>
  <li>Server sends from a different IP address to client's first port, the port that RakNet is connected on. 
If received, then the client will accept datagrams from any source IP address to a port already in use. This is therefore  full-cone NAT. s2p3 is used for this.</li>
  <li>Server sends from the second port on the already-connected IP 
address, s1p2. If received, then the client is using address-restricted cone 
NAT.</li>
  <li>Client sends to another IP address on the server, from its first 
(already connected) port. If the IP address and port is the same, then 
the client uses the same external IP address and port to all connections
 from the same source address. This is port-restricted NAT.</li>
  <li>Else symmetric NAT.</li>
</ol>

 may wish to host your own for consistent uptime). The server must have 
enough external IP addresses, as described in <strong>NAT Type Detection
 Algorithm</strong>.</li>
