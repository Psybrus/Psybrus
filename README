Leave My Lettuce Alone - Alone
- LD22 entry by Neil Richardson (NeiloGD).
====================================================

Executable is "Game_Production.exe"

Whilst your owner is away, you, a black cat, have been left to guard
the families lettuce patches. It's currently breeding season for rabbits,
so there are lots of hungry kittens about.

Controls are very simple, the black cat will always follow your cursor,
and the rabbits will be avoiding the black cat whilst also trying to eat
all of the lettuce. The rabbits hate being seperated, so what you need to
do is try to split them up so they get scared and run away whilst simultaneously
preventing the lettuce patches from being eaten!

All game code is written in C++, and my own engine, Psybrus, was used.
