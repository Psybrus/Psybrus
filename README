Psybrus Engine & Tool Chain
===========================

Introduction:
-------------
My personal engine which I use for Ludum Dare, tech prototyping, and testing out new ideas.

Root Game Projects:
-------------------
- ExampleGame is a previous Ludum Dare entry that I use as a test bed currently. It is not always in a fully working state (but should be really).
- TemplateGame is a very bare project which has an example component class, and loads in a model.

How to create a new project:
----------------------------
- Copy the "TemplateGame" folder and name it whatever you like.
- Update the project name in premake4.lua file that exists within that folder.
- Update the root premake4.lua file to build only the games you wish.
- Run the appropriate batch file to create either vs2008 or vs2010 projects. These will go into the "Build/[vs2008/vs2010]" folder, the solution is "Psybrus.sln".

How to run the game:
--------------------
- Set the working directory of the game project in Visual Studio to be the "Dist" folder within your game's folder.
- When ran in Debug or Release, the game will reimport the content. Production will only load PackedContent.
