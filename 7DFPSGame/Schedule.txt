7DFPS Schedule stuffs:
- Implement simple BSP.
- - Doom-like, no height or slopes.
- - Need to know if we're in solid or not for the air pressure simulation code.
- Port 2D water surface simulation code to 3D for air pressure.
- - May need to multithread this. Gonna be CPU intensive.
- - Investigate doing this on GPU, either with shaders or OpenCL/Cuda.
- Implement volume rendering for said simulation code.
- - Particle cloud with a 3D texture?
- - Look up in the simulation buffers and render manually?
- Prototype visual->audio rendering.
- - Render from ear perspective and IFFT?
- - Take a simple trace on one plane and convert depth to pitch?
- Need a story or some narrative.
- - Augmentation gone wrong?
- - Born this way?
- - Tripping out?
